	<meta name="description" content="Merge adventure game where your goal is to combine slimes to make them stronger. By merging two slimes, you create a more powerful slime with new looks and weapons. Use your slimes to fight waves of monsters as you progress through the dungeon. Defeating monsters earns you money, which you can use to buy even more slimes. Keep merging, fighting, and upgrading to conquer tougher enemies and see if you have what it takes to beat the dungeon! ">
